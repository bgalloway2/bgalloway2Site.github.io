                This is a basic 2D overhead perspective car game that was created using Processing, a java-based language. The goal of this project was to create a game that allowed a user to control a car shown on the screen using the arrow keys. As time continues, obstacles will randomly spawn on the road and the user must avoid them. When a user collides with an obstacle, the game ends.  
            </div>

                <h2>My Project Goal</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="a">
                My focus for implementation of this project was to create three primary classes in Processing. This would include the background display that the car would drive within. The car itself, and the obstacles that would randomly spawn.

                            <p>The class shown on the right was how I implemented both the background movement and the car itself. While the car was fixed to the bottom of the screen, the road itself would scroll to create a movement effect. I then constained the movement of the car so it wouldnt go outside of the road limits.

                            <p>In this obstacle class I set the obstacles images to randomly spawn in various locations within the roads boundaries. If there was any time that the obstacle collided with the car represented at the bottom of the screen, the game would end.

                            <p>Below is a screenshot of what the game itself looked like. The car at the bottom was shifted from left to right using the arrow keys on the keyboard. The end condition for the game was if the car came in contact with any of the obstacles.</p>

                            <p>This project was a success overall. I was able to meet the goal to have a car stay within a constained area and end the game in the case of a collision. Though there were features that were not added because of lack of time. An example of this would be a database to keep the high score of users who play after a round.</p>
