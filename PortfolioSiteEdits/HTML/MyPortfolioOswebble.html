                Oswebble a Scrabble inspired mobile web application game. 
                A group of developers and designers (students) were tasked to build an 
                Oswego themed game for SUNY Oswego for on campus recreation. I acted as team leader to the GUI team, tasked with creating both a mobile app interface and  
                The work was done using an agile methodology with weekly sprints. an interface for the kiosk screen users would interact with. The goals of our team were to ensure we met every requirement that project manager gave us, so users could enjoy a smoothexperience.

            <div class="a">
                My team was expected to work closely with requirements to ensure that our interface accounted for every feature the project manager requested. From this, we were tasked with creating a number of wireframes for each of these features. We were then expected to design a prototype based off of these for user-testing. The final steps were to develop an interface screen for both the mobile application users would interact with, and the kiosk screen that displayed the moved of each player in the game.

                            <p>Overall our team and all involved teams were able to integrate multiple parts of a system together to create a fully functioning game that allowed users to connect and drop from an online scrabble game. The application featured AI that would take the place when uniuque users werent present. The logic on the board was accurate and prevented players from making moves  that broke the game rules. </p>
