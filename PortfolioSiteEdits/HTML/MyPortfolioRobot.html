            <div class="a">
                This GoPiGo robot navigational controller was a project that focused on allowing a user to interact with a map represented within a web application. Users would select both a start and end destination. This signal would then be sent to a GoPiGo robot located on the ground. The robot was then expected to calculate the shortest possible route that it could take to reach the users desired location.

            </div>
            <div class="a">
                My team was expected to design and implement a system that would allow the robot to take a users command, and then be able to determine the necessary turns that it would make to reach the destination. The robot also had to determine the distance of each path it could take so it could calculate which direction would be faster.

                In order for my team to reach these goals two things need to be done. First we needed to identify an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm. This is what was used to find the shortest path within the map. The next step was to read through and master the predefined methods within the Dexter Industries GoPiGo API. This is what would allow us to calibrate the line sensor that makes the robot move.

                            <p>This diagram shows the flow of the map interface. This mobile application was expected to recieve user input, send the selected nodes to the GoPiGo,  and then identify how many edges (or turns) it will encounter for each of the possible paths.

                            <p>The interface that is shown below is the map web application. This is what users would interact with to send the commands to the GoPiGo robot. To do this, a start node would be selected from one of the outer blue circles on the map. A second blue node would be cliked for an end location. The users selection was shown in the text box on the right, followed by a series of buttons to let people edit their selection.</p>

                            <p>The team for this project was overall successful. We were able to idenfity and  implement a python version of the Dijkstra algorithm, work with the Dexter Industries API to accept the movement commands necessary for robot movement, and successfully sent commands from our interface to the robot. Hardware issues within the robot itself were inconsistent, and sometimes commands would not be executed properly. </p>
