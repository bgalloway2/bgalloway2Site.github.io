                <h2 style="text-align: left;"> My Education</h2>
                <br>
                <p style="text-align: left;">I am a user-experience designer with a focus on creating interfaces that are exciting to look at, but also have an ease-of-use that satisfies target users. With an MA in Human-Computer Interaction, and a BA in Psychology, I am able to look at designs from a user-perspective. I have also taken time to learn certain programming languages, allowing me to see things from a developers perspective. This allows me to create work that satisies all user needs.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 style="text-align: left;"> My Experience</h2>
                <br>
                <p style="text-align: left;">During my time studying, I was able to collaborate with a number of groups on different design projects. The skills I learned from these projects range from a number of user flow charts, wireframes, and prototyping, to low level development. The experiences with these groups has shown me how to work independently, but also remotely with people who may not be readily available when needed.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="text-align: left;">This has allowed me to develop the necessary <b>communication and self-discipline</b> rules to meet project deadlines, as well as manage working with large numbers of people on a single project. The experience I bring to the table includes web and mobile app design, and how to work in fast-paced development environments.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 style="text-align: left;"> My Hobbies</h2>
                <br>
                <p style="text-align: left;">Outside of work my main focus is music. I have played guitar most of my life and enjoy working on music projects with other local musicians. Through this, I have played in a number of bands and had experience traveling around the Central New York area to play. I'm a person who always likes to create something. Whether that be through my work in design, or music, I am always able to keep my mind active.</p>
